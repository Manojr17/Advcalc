An Advanced Calculator is a powerful computational tool designed to perform a wide range of mathematical operations beyond basic arithmetic.

Unlike standard calculators, which can only handle simple operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Advanced calculators are widely used by engineers, scientists, students, and professionals for solving complex mathematical problems efficiently.

Some calculators also support programming features, allowing users to write small scripts for custom calculations.

It can do:

      *Square roots and powers
      *Trigonometry (like sin, cos, tan)
      *Logarithms
      *Big equations
      *Store and recall numbers

Why use an advanced calculator?

      *To save time
      *To solve hard problems easily
      *To do accurate and fast calculations
